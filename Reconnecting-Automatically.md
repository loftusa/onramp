`mosh` and `et` [Eternal Terminal](https://eternalterminal.dev/) are both installed in `thevisible.net`, and both are `ssh` alternatives that will automatically re-establish a connection after it is broken.

They are very useful to use instead of `ssh` on your laptop, because then you can close and reopen your laptop lid, and it will work.
